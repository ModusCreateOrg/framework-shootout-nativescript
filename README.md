# Framework Shootout - Nativescript

## Setup
1. Install nativescript by following the [official guide](http://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-os-x).
2. Change to root of this project and run `tns install`. This will install nativescript core modules and setup platforms.

## Get rolling
Following commands are fairly self-explanatory and should get you rolling in no-time:

```bash
tns emulate android
tns emulate ios

tns run android
tns run ios

tns livesync android --watch
tns livesync ios --watch

tns livesync android --emulator --watch
tns livesync ios --emulator --watch
```

Tip: Use a real device whereever possible. Livesyncing on ios emulator currently has some issues with outputting errors and `console.log` outputs.
